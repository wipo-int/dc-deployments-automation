# Version logic:
#
# At this point we have 3 values (possibly empty):
#
# * atl_product_version (supplied)
# * atl_cached_version
# * atl_latest_version
#
# If no cached value, use the supplied value or 'latest' if unset.
#
# If a cached file exists, and the requested version is 'latest' (or
# unset), cache wins.
#
# If a version is set, then it is honoured _if_ it is higher than the
# cached value (i.e. upgrade path).
